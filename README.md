This is a Todo App written in TypeScript.
Within the WebApp, you can make lists of anything you want. 
You can store multiple lists and delete them when you're done.
Switch between lists, make changes, add or delete, and everything will be saved when you switch back.

## Programming Highlights:

- Built in TypeScript.
- The program can create, read, update and delete the lists and todos added by the user.
- Using local storage lists are saved in the userâ€™s browser, so the website can keep track of added lists even when users leave the webpage and return later.
- UI built entirely by hand. No outside packages needed.
